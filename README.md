 Squirrels, yes the legendary squirrels have been added, at the cost of my javafx assignment that I spent 22 hours trying to solve! This was very much a wholesome and refereshing addition compared to that tragedy to  my grade. We have addded XXXS boards for the little fellas, maybe we will add XXXXXXXL boards for bears and lions one day! (This is for my C++ assignment for Week 05)
